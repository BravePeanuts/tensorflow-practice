I assume that you have grasped the basic knowledge of machine learning and deep learning. If not, I recommand the courses: cs231 and [深度学习基础课程](http://study.163.com/course/courseMain.htm?courseId=1005023019)

I also assume that you are familiar with the python language, especially for numpy libaray.
