## Machine learning and deep learning

I assume that you have grasped the basic knowledge of machine learning and deep learning. If not, I recommand the courses as bellow: 
- [深度学习基础课程](http://study.163.com/course/courseMain.htm?courseId=1005023019)
- [CS229:Machine Learning](http://cs229.stanford.edu/)
- [CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition)](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/)

## Programming
I also assume that you are familiar with the python language, especially for numpy libaray.

If you're a layman about Python, you can chioce a book suitable for you from the answer of [关于 Python 的经典入门书籍有哪些？](https://www.zhihu.com/question/19593179)

For learning numpy, I suggest you read [quickstart tutorial](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/user/quickstart.html). Importantly, you should always consult its [manual](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/reference/index.html) whenever you are not clear about some function.
