## [What is TensorFlow](https://tensorflow.google.cn/)
Open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs.

Nodes in the graph represent mathermatical operations, while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays(tensors) communicated between them. The overview of a similar graph of a three-layer neural network in TensorFlow shows below:

## Why Tensorflow
- Flexibility
- Scalability
- Popularity

## Data Flow Graphs
- Phase 1: assemble a graph
- Phase 2: use a session to execute operations in the graph
